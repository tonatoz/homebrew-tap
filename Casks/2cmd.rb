  caveats <<~EOS
    2cmd is signed with a project certificate and is not notarized, and
    Homebrew quarantines everything it downloads. Gatekeeper spawns a quarantined
    build and then holds it before it runs: the process is listed in Activity
    Monitor, but no menu bar icon ever appears. Clear the flag once:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/2cmd.app"
      open "#{appdir}/2cmd.app"

    Installing with "brew install --cask --no-quarantine tonatoz/tap/2cmd" skips
    the flag. Then enable 2cmd in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.
