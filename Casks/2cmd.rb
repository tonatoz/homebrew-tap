  # Homebrew quarantines every download, unconditionally: the --no-quarantine flag
  # and its HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS equivalent were removed in July 2026. A quarantined
  # build signed with an unknown certificate chain is spawned and then held by
  # Gatekeeper before main() runs, so the app appears in Activity Monitor with no
  # menu bar icon and no window. Dropping the flag here is what makes the app
  # launchable at all until the release is notarized.

  caveats <<~EOS
    2cmd is signed with a project certificate and is not notarized, so this cask
    clears the quarantine flag Homebrew attaches to the download — otherwise
    Gatekeeper holds the app before it starts and it never reaches the menu bar.

    Then enable 2cmd in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility.
